The price and quantity indexes from the site Coinmarketcap.com  were used to this article  by Dec 2017 12:00 PM UTC.
The values and market capitalizations of more than 1360 cryptocurrencies are traced in the site Coinmarketcap.com.  
According to the information from the site, cryptocurrency market capitalizations are currently at a premium $600,4 billion. 
In my opinion, about third of this amount ($200 billion)  is  scam. 
In this article I will help you find scam schemes in the cryptocurrencies market.  Also I will help you check the 
cryptocurrencies software. Then we will analyse all cryptocurrencies with capitalization above $0.5 billion. So we can 
understand is the cryptocurrency suitable for long time investment or it can be used just for short time speculations.
The main thing is Blockchain technology. Blockchain is a new financial transactions technology. The Blockchain is a time-
tested technology. More than 7 years the Bitcoin network functions without failures. The Blockchain let us make  financial 
transactions anonymously (without intermediaries). We don't need any financial intermediaries (banks, stock exchanges, 
centralized payment systems  - Visa, MasterCard  etc) and their computing powers.  As all  financial transactions are 
done through coins, so cryptocurrency market capitalization is growing. Cryptocurrency transactions will replace current 
financial schemes step by step (such as exchange trading, banking transactions, commercial transactions etc). In my 
opinion, in time cryptocurrencies technology will displace current financial institutions. 
Nowadays there are more than 1360 cryptocurrencies. Therefore we need to know which ones will remain at the 
marketplace. What share of the market will have this or that cryptocurrency?
Also cryptocurrencies let us  get rid of  state control over any type of financial transactions. Because of that 
cryptocurrency market became  an ideal place for making financial pyramids and other scam schemes. 
The main instrument that can be used to check the cryptocurrencies is forum bitcointalk.org.  We can find here 
announcements and news of the all cryptocurrencies.  Also the community discusses  merits and demerits of   a particular 
coin or software  at the forum. Bitcointalk.org is  the oldest cryptocurrencies forum (it acts  since 2010). Often you can find 
out an exclusive here.  
Also here you can always get the link to the service github.com. GitHub offers plans for free repositories which are 
commonly used to host open-source software projects. This website provides information about the source code of the 
cryptocurrencies software, program development. Also here you can read the messages about any errors found and 
speed of their removing.  
If you didn't find discussions of the cryptocurrency at the forum bitcointalk.org  or you didn't find the source code of it's 
software at the github.com, so this cryptocurrency  is just scam. 
You can check the software of the chosen cryptocurrency at the github.com  through these tabs:
Code/commits - here you can see, which  module is  in developing  now 
Code/Releases - here you can see  chronology of releases
Code/contributors - here you can see  list of  developers and planning for the software development
Issues, Pull requests - here you can see  the problems identified, speed of their solutions.
You shouldn't pay attention to stars repository. A lot of projects increase quantity of the stars by scam methods.

For example, we will try analyse the coin Verge (XVG). Within a week the Verge grown up  four times. The coin's 
capitalization reached around $0.985 billion by Dec 17, 2017.  Now we will  look in the forum bitcointalk.org:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=770742.msg8696565#msg8696565
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=817937.0
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1053864
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1365894.0
The first block of the Verge started in Sept 09, 2014. Before  rebranding the coin was called Dogecoindark. If you read the 
forum bitcointalk.org, you'll know a lot of interesting things about this currency. The current Verge's release is in 
repository:  https://github.com/vergecurrency/VERGE

Founders' Reward
All cryptocurrencies are open-source software projects. So the another instrument that can be used to analyse the 
cryptocurrencies is the coin's creation. 
The main question: Do the founders have   any benefits over all the other users during  cryptocurrencies creation?  If 
YES, we have uneven distribution of the coins. So a small number of persons have large number of coins. There is a risk 
of concurrent  sale of the cryptocoins. In this case value of the cryptocurrency will fall dramatically. So if the founders take 
part of the coins for themselves as a reward, I don't recommend use such cryptocurrency for long time investment.
For example, we have cryptocurrency A-coin. And the founders take part of the A-coins for themselves as a reward. 
Because A-coin is open-source software project, another persons can start one more cryptocurrency (B-coin) by copying 
source code of the A-coins. Scheme of B-coins creation would be changed (it would be more even). In this case the B-
coin is a fork of the A-coin. Investments in the B-coin are more favorable, because B-coin market capitalization will 
become larger than A-coin.
Now we will analyse the cryptocurrencies with capitalization above $0.5 billion, in which the Founders' Reward is more 
than 1% of the coins: 
1) Zcash (ZEC)
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1626185.0
https://github.com/zcash/zcash
Capitalization: $1.399 billion
Founders' Reward: 20% of current quantity of the coins 
2) Hshare (HSR)
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2097413.0
https://github.com/HcashOrg/Hshare
Capitalization: $0.956 billion
Founders' Reward: 10% - premining. 
ICO&Pre-ICO: 50% (see below)  
PoS: 25% (see below)  
3) Bytecoin (BCN)
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=512747.0
https://github.com/amjuarez/bytecoin
Capitalization: $0.770 billion
Founders' Reward: more than 50% - premining. 
The cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH)  will be discussed below.

Another scam schemes will be analysed in the second part of the article. I'll try make it as soon as possible.  :)
