PoS (Proof-of-Stake), PoI (Proof-of-importance) etc

The second scheme of coin's creation is PoS (Proof-of-Stake), PoI (Proof-of-importance) etc.  
Newly created coins are distributed among the members of the cryptocurrency network in 
proportion to the share owned by member, in using such schemes.  But investors need to freeze 
their coins to receive the reward (newly created cryptocoins). Of course, more and more investors 
will freeze their coins. And as a result, less and less coins will remain for financial transactions. It 
makes lack of the cryptocurrency in circulation. And value of the cryptocurrency will grow rapidly. 

Then this financial pyramid will reach its top, and value of the cryptocurrency will fall down.  The 
investors will begin unfreeze their coins to get rid of depreciated funds. It makes oversupply of the 
cryptocurrency in circulation. In this case value of the cryptocurrency will fall dramatically.  So I 
don't recommend use such cryptocurrency (with PoS, PoI etc methods of coins creation) for long 
time investment.

Now we will analyse the cryptocurrencies with capitalization above $0.5 billion, in which PoS, PoI 
etc coins creation schemes are used:
1) DASH (Dash)
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.0
https://github.com/dashpay/dash
Capitalization: $8.444 billion

2) BitConnect (BCC)
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1681719.0
https://github.com/bitconnectcoin/bitconnectcoin
Capitalization: $2.184 billion

3) Decred (DCR)
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1290358.0
https://github.com/decred/dcrd
Capitalization: $0.564 billion

4) Siacoin (SC)
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1060294.0
https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia
Capitalization: $0.522 billion


ICO (Initial coin offering)

The third scheme of coin's creation is ICO. It is a sale of a number of newly created coins to 
investors. There are three important points dealing with ICO:

1) An initial coin offering is a crowdfunding. It is a funding of startup companies. Investors buy 
some quantity of tokens. These tokens become real cryptocoins when the project launches.
2) But token buyers haven't the same rights as shareholders (the stock owners). 
3) As all cryptocurrencies are  anonymous open-source software projects, so  the copyrights for 
software  can not be protected. So if the ICO's funding goal is met (your startup is successful), the 
software will be copied by another founders for other projects soon. And you can lose your profit.

In my opinion, investments in tokens during the ICO's funding are:
-	voluntary donations for scientific research in the field of cryptocurrencies` technologies;
-	or short time speculation in the cryptocurrencies markets. In this case we count on rapid 
increase of the cryptocurrency value.

In the future legislation on cryptocurrencies` technologies would be drafted.  And we will have:
-	cryptocoins creation by State. In this case the State will guarantee the pegging a 
cryptocurrency to one currency like the dollar.
-	crypto securities of the companies and  funds. They will be directly distributed among 
investors (without any financial institutions).

Cryptocurrency Tether (USDT) can be the basis for a cryptocurrency with State guarantees. Its 
current capitalization is $1.127 billion. The value of one USDT cryptocoin is $1. But without legal 
framework investments in the Tether have not been successful:

Now I would like to bring to your attention cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH). 
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428589.0
https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum
Capitalization: $ 69.548 billion
To this day, 96.4 million Ethereum tokens were created. So the value of one ETH cryptocoin is 
$690. In 2014 year 60,102,216 ETH were sold during the ICO's funding at a price $0.31. The 
founders' reward amounted to ETH 12 million.      
Therefore, 62.3% of current quantity of the Ethereum coins were sold during the ICO's funding. 
12.4% of the current quantity of the Ethereum coins is founders' reward.  
In 2016 year Ethereum was hardforked into two separate blockchains: the new hardforked version 
became Ethereum (ETH), and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC). Current 
capitalization of Ethereum Classic is $3.449 billion. The coins that are in wallets at the time of the 
hardfork, end up in the wallets of both cryptocurrencies (are doubled).  
So  money ($18,439,086), which were invested  in Ethereum tokens during the ICO's funding  in 
2014 year, have increased 2581 times: 
($ 69. 548 billion + $3,449 billion)/ 92 360 000 ETH *  60 102 216 ETH / $0.0184 billion = 2581 
times.
How could this happen? 

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It is a platform for making ICO of new crypto tokens. This 
platform is known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
There is no need to create new cryptocurrency for making new ICO. There's only enough to carry 
out an extensive advertising campaign and to involve solid developers.
The Ethereum tokens capitalization is $25.377 billion according to Coinmarketcap.com.   Buying 
and selling of such tokens are made for ETH coins. So the more tokens on a platform Ethereum 
are created, the quicker the Ethereum coins value will increase. 
Ethereum isn't the only platform for making ICO of new crypto tokens.  But the Ethereum`s 
founders were the first who figured out how to make their financial pyramid of the scores of smaller 
financial pyramids. 
The Ethereum tokens with capitalization above $0.5 billion are shown in table 1.

Table 1 (Billion Dollars)
--------------------------
Cryptocurrency		Market Capitalizations
EOS (EOS) 		 4.619
TRON (TRX)		 2.433
Populous (PPT)		 1.992
OmiseGO (OMG)		 1.465
Binance Coin (BNB)	 0.642
Status (SNT)		 0.594
Veritaseum (VERI)	 0.579
SALT (SALT)		 0.525
other 339 Ethereum 
tokens, with Market 
Capitalization  less 
than $0.5 billion	12.529

So the Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Ethereum Tokens total capitalization is $98.375 billion. I 
hope Ethereum stays not only just a financial pyramid, but its software will form the basis for the 
first Stock exchange based on Blockchain technology.  

Other cryptocurrencies, where coins creation is ICO, with capitalization above $0.5 billion are 
shown in table 2.
Table 2 (Billion Dollars)
-------------------------
Cryptocurrency		Market Capitalizations
Ripple (XRP)		28.691
Cardano (ADA)		13.199
IOTA (IOTA)		 9.903
NEM (XEM)		 6.190
Stellar (XLM)		 4.697
NEO (NEO)		 3.709
Qtum (QTUM)		 2.172
Lisk (LSK)		 1.391
Waves (WAVES)		 1.341
Tether (USDT)		 1.127
Stratis (STRAT)		 1.081
BitShares (BTS)		 1.060
Ardor (ARDR)		 0.958
Nxt (NXT)		 0.809
Ark (ARK)		 0.580
Steem (STEEM)		 0.559
Other 90 ICO tokens, 
with Market Capitalization  
less than $0.5 billion	 1.717

Earlier we reviewed four scam schemes in the cryptocurrencies market.  Total capitalization of all 
above-named cryptocurrencies  (with 339 Ethereum tokens and 90 others tokens with market 
capitalization less than $0.5 billion) is about  $191.2 billion according to Coinmarketcap.com. It's a 
third of the current cryptocurrency market capitalization. 

Now I will describe the last scam scheme.  There is no these $191.2 billion. As all 
cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so founders can sell their tokens to themselves. They can put 
only a small part of their tokens on the market to increase demand and tokens value. 
So we see: all scam schemes in the cryptocurrencies market are in using the unfair methods of 
coin's creation.  The only fair method of coins creation is PoW (Proof-of-work). 

The fair schemes of the cryptocurrencies market will be analysed in the third part of the article. I'll 
try make it as soon as possible.  :)
